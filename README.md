Eclypse_BI_Project_Tool
=======================

NodeRed utility to auto-generate the site and BACNet controllers for an Eclypse Building Intelligence Project

### About

This is a Nod-Red tool to populate your Distech Controls ECLYPSE Building Intelligence project via manual entry or CSV file uploads.  This tool will allow you to upload CSV files of your building layout (building, floors, spaces), equipment for each and corresponding BACNet remote devices and points.  This is being accomplished via RESTful API calls to your device.  CSV files are provided for you to use as examples.

If you have a BI device to use, load the flow and use the NodeRed UI to build your project.
